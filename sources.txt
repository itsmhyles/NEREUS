State Legislature Control (40% weight)
- Chamber control: 20 points
- Margin control: 10 points
- Length control: 10 points
- Party in control indicates direction

Executive Control (30% weight)
Presidential Election Results (30% weight)
- Points based on margin of victory
- Higher margin = more points
- Winner's party indicates direction

Governatorial Control (30% weight)
- Party alignment: 15 points
- Margin victory: 10 points
- Length control: 5 points


Example of how the political index works given the scoring components:
For Michigan's example:
Democratic points:
Presidential: 3 points (narrow D win)
Governor: 23 points (D control)
Total D: 26 points
Republican points:
Legislature: 38 points (R control)
Total R: 38 points
Therefore, Michigan's index of 64 with more Republican points indicates a slight Republican lean despite mixed control. 
The lower total_index (64/100) suggests a competitive/moderate state rather than strong partisan control.


The margin calculation:
Takes the total points earned by each party across all three components:
Presidential voting (max 30 points)
Legislature control (max 40 points)
Governor control (max 30 points)
Calculates the difference between winning and losing party's points
Divides by total possible points between both parties
Multiplies by 100 to get percentage


A 15% margin in elections is considered significant because:
Most competitive elections are decided by single-digit margins
A 15% margin represents a strong victory in electoral terms
Very few races see margins above 30%
