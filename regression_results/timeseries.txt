## Key Insights

1. **Political Correlation**
- States with increasing homelessness tend to be Democratic-leaning
- States with decreasing homelessness tend to be Republican-leaning
- However, correlation doesn't imply causation

2. **Variability Patterns**
- Higher baseline rates tend to have higher standard deviations: This means states with higher homelessness rates tend to experience larger fluctuations in their numbers year to year.
- More volatile in states with larger populations
- Climate may play a role in variability: States with extreme weather variations show more volatility in homeless rates

3. **Rate Ranges**
- Mean rates vary widely (58.75 to 446.53)
- Standard deviations show significant differences in stability
- Most states fall between 100-155 per 100,000 residents

This analysis suggests complex relationships between political leaning, policy approaches, and homelessness outcomes, warranting deeper investigation of specific policies and local factors.
