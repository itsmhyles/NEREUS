Primary Datasets Required
- Homelessness Data
Climate Data
- Average temperatures by state/city
Political Data
- State political leaning 
- State government control history
- Policy implementations related to homelessness

Proposed Analysis Methods
1. Regression Models
Multiple linear regression with dependent variable: homelessness rate
Independent variables:
Average temperature
Temperature variation
Political control
Housing costs
Population density
2. Comparative Analysis
Create state clusters based on:
Climate zones
Political leaning
Homelessness rates
Compare:
Red vs. Blue states with similar climates
Similar political leaning with different climates

Key Considerations
Methodological Challenges
Confounding Variables
Housing costs
Cost of living
Local policies
Economic indicators
Social services availability
Data Quality Issues
Point-in-Time count limitations
Varying definitions of homelessness
Inconsistent reporting methods
Research Questions to Address
Is there a stronger correlation between climate and homelessness than political affiliation?
How does the sheltered/unsheltered ratio vary by climate zone?
Do states with similar climates have similar homelessness patterns regardless of political control?
